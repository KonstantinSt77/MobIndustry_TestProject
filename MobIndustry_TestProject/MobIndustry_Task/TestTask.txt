Task with my comments:

+ Create an application with one screen which contains a table with expanded cells.
+ Also page should have a navigation bar and a refresh button.
+ Simulate request to the network, which receives response in json format (use provided cars.json file).

Optional: 
1. Use MVVM -> (Use MVP not MVC)
2. Use Database to cache fetched data -> (Use Realm get data when refresh)
